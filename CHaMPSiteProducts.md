# CHaMP Site Products

Successful completion of the CHaMP protocol at a site leads to production of the following:

**[Metrics:](https://github.com/SouthForkResearch/CHaMP_Metrics/wiki)**  Visit-specific summaries of physical site features at the time of sampling.  Tabular metrics are generated by the following engines:

* auxiliary
* topographic
* topographic-auxiliary  

[Site Properties]([https://riverscapes.github.io/CHaMPAutomation/engines/SiteProps.html](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Friverscapes.github.io%2FCHaMPAutomation%2Fengines%2FSiteProps.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE9b4jDBhEyhPn2Ym4g_CsFqOjHbg)):  Topographic control networks for each site packaged for scouting map generation, crew evaluation and use, and upload to total stations. 

**Topographic Survey Files (Visit-specific)**: Raw survey input and post-processed topographic output files files packaged into a [hierarchical folder structure](http://champtools.northarrowresearch.com/9_technical_reference/project/) by the [TopoToolbar](champtools.northarrowresearch.com) 

**CAD Files (Visit-specific):**  Post-processed topographic survey files in a CAD-friendly file format. These files are a specific subset of topographic survey products.

[Fish-Habitat Model Products](): A set of juvenile and spawner habitat model products ready produced using a preset suite of fish-habitat relationships.  There are several fish-habitat models produced by the [Habitat Model](habitat.northarrowresearch.com) software

* **habitat suitability index (HSI)-based capacity:** 
* **fuzzy inference (FIS) habitat capacity version 1:**
* **fuzzy inference (FIS) habitat capacity version 2:** In 2017, the fuzzy inference habitat capacity models were updated to include structural elements and aspects of fish cover.
[* **NREI**](http://isemp.org/projects/nrei/): Net Rate Energy Intake
* **QRF capacity:**

 



Fish-Habitat Models (Fuzzy Inference): In 2017 the Fish-Habitat models were updated to include 

NREI

#### Retired file types

Site Geodatabases and Survey Geodatabases were retired after the 2016 field season.  These files utilized the proprietary ESRI 'geodatabase' file format and have been replaced by the 'Site Properties' and 'Topographic File' products.
