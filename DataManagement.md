# Data Management



The CHaMP Data Management System is currently designed to support the data collection, processing and product generation.  Current efforts are now focusing on improving product exposure and availability to interested parties, including CHaMP participants, analysts, and interested managers.

From 2011-2013 CHaMP focused most of the Data Management efforts on streamlining data collection, processing, and metric generation.  This included mechanisms to electronically capture and perform quality assurance checks while in the field, post-process data
