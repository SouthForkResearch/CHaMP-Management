## Other Measurement Data

There is an alternative data flow and storage process for several sets of data. These data are temporarily housed in a cloud-based server environment (Egnyte) until uploaded to champmonitoring.org

1) Macroinvertebrates:  Macroinvertebrate samples are sent to Rhithron for processing and then processed data files are stored in Egnyte until upload to champmonitoring.org ([MacroInvertData](https://isemp.egnyte.com/fl/0W5rrJ86Pa).  A set of original processed files from Rhithron are kept in Egnyte.

2) Topographic surveys that are partially wet or dry and do not meet perennial water requirements are uploaded to Egnyte.  These data are inconsistent with the protocol requirements but are stored as programmatic data for future use. 

3) Solar pathfinder data collected from 2012-2016 are stored on Egnyte ([SolarPathfinderOutput](https://isemp.egnyte.com/fl/05wPnIMunk)).  The program switched to Sun Eye use in 2012, but the device is no longer manufactured. Crews have used solar pathfinders to collect solar input data, but there is no mechanism to store non-2011 solar input files and metrics on champmonitoring.org.  This is a known update, but due to funding restrictions is not a high priority at this time.

4) Non-core CHaMP data with upload difficulties.  Several datasets are stored in Egnyte ([CHaMP_ExtraVisitsInformation](https://isemp.egnyte.com/fl/eJzIFVKwGm)) that belong to non-core CHaMP users that are outside of the program's ability to upload at this time. These data are stored as part of the CHaMP program, but are not available for upload until the system makes this cost-effective and possible for non-CHaMP users.
