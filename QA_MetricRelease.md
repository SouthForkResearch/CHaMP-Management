# Step 9: Metric Release

When metrics are **_Released To the Public_**, the Measurements, Metrics, and [Site Products](CHaMPSiteProducts.md) become available for download without logging in to champmonitoring.org.  Measurements and Metrics that have not been Released are available internally with the appropriate User Permissions.

In 2017, metrics will be released by 12/31/17.

Metrics are Released by the CHaMP Program Quality Assurance Coordinator after crews have completed within-season [Quality Assurance Review Steps 1-8](QAMain.md).  The Quality Assurance Coordinator does Program-wide review of metrics and reviews and across-year review of metrics for consistency and completeness prior to release.   

Note that products will always be available from the Site Details and Visit pages of champmonitoring.org, but bulk downloads of all [Site Products](CHaMPSiteProducts.md) for an entire Watershed may not be available.
