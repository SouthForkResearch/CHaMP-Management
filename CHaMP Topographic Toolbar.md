# CHaMP Topographic Toolbar	

#### Development and Update Process

CHaMP developed an ArcGIS Add-In toolbar to facilitate processing topographic survey data collected during CHaMP surveys.  Each year the functionality of the toolbar is reviewed based on:

- performance of previous year's toolbar (code bugs, usability, crew feedback)
- supporting metric generation (does the toolbar adequately check data quality or guide in feature development that is required for metric generation?)
- alignment to protocol (is the toolbar processing data consistent with the current-year protocol?)



Annual Timeline
Dec-Feb: Toolbar functional requirements scoped and contracted
Mar-Apr: Core toolbar updates developed
May: Toolbar testing
June 1: Training version of toolbar
July 1: Field season version of toolbar
July-Sept: Crew support and troubleshooting. Critical releases only.

#### Development Team

Philip Bailey (North Arrow Research) is the Lead Developer for the Topographic Toolbar.  He is primarily supported by Kelly Whitehead (South Fork Research), with some tool-specific support from James Hensleigh (???) and Jesse Langdon (South Fork Research).  Carol Volk (South Fork Research) and Joe Wheaton (Utah State University) provide development guidance.

#### Code Curation and Storage

Philip Bailey has managed a private [Topo Toolbar Add-In](https://bitbucket.org/northarrowresearch/champ-topo-toolbar-add-in) code repository for code management since the 2012 Toolbar Add-In was developed.  

Kelly Whitehead produced an ArcGIS Toolbox to support the development of the 2011 CHaMP Data Collection (REPO LINK).
