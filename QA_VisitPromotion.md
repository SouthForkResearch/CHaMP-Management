# Step 8: Visit Promotion

Visit promotion shifts visits from the *'In QA*' Visit Phase to the *'Data Approved'* Phase.  Promoted Visits mean that the data streams are as complete as possible for a visit and metrics have been reviewed by Crew Leads.  Since there is only Visit-scale promotion, the program does allow promotion of Visits that have incomplete metrics or datasets as long as the following conditions are met:

<u>Visits should be promoted IF:</u>

* Available datasets (and metrics) are accurate and have been reviewed by the Crew Lead.
* All expected data products from the protocol have been checked in or accounted for.


* Available datasets are considered valuable to others.
* QA Status notes have been added to describe all incomplete/unexpected results from the Visit.
* The majority of the protocol-specified data are available and pass review by a Crew Lead.
* Site Location and Permissions indicate Data Sharing is allowed.

### To Promote Visits:

1. Ensure all metrics for a visit have been reviewed.  If data collected for the visit was for an AEM-specific or AEM+CHaMP Protocol, the AEM QA Process and Protocol should be completed PRIOR to promoting a visit.
2. Navigate to an individual Visit by clicking on a VistID in [champmonitoring.org](www.champmonitoring.org).
3. From the Metric tab for the Visit (aka Site Details page) click  “Promote Data”
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all current year Visits have been promoted.
5. Note that the Visit Status and Visit Phase attributes are available in numerous grids and can be used to quickly sort Visits by promotion state.
