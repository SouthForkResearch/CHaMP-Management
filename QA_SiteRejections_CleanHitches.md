3. Review all Visits with Visit Status =Planned.  Make sure these Visits either:

   1. Are currently being post-processed and will have data uploaded soon.

   2. Have updated site evaluations because no data is expected for these visits.

   3. Are removed from the hitch since they were not sampled.
