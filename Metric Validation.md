# Metric Validation

Metric calculations are validated against a truth dataset after the following events:

1) New or updated metric calculation

2) Changes to metric input (e.g. measurements) storage or format that could affect metric calculations

3) Changes to calculation engines

4) Changes to metric display (this sometimes warrants calculation review, depending on the nature of the metric display change)



## Truth Datasets

CHaMP maintains truth datasets for topographic surveys, auxillary metrics, and stream temperature.  The truth datasets are stored outside of the production environment (champmonitoring.org) so that these data are not subjected to changes by crews or CHaMP staff.

Topographic Truth Datasets are stored in Egnyte.  These data are updated as needed to meet current topographic processing standards through the Topographic Toolbar.
