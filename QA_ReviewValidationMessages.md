# Step 6: Review Validation Messages

All processed topographic data products (TopoData.zip packages) are run through a Validation Engine which runs a [series of checks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nlVYtqw8S5gsp83_EXSj4BD0Wmtc4AYBp5RUGWdCJGw/edit#gid=584951703) against each topographic file to make sure expected topographic survey products are complete and meet requirements for metric generation.  

Metric engines do not depend on a passing status for all validation messages.  This means that some some metrics might be possible to generate for a visit while others are not possible.  Validation messages can be used to determine why metrics weren't generated.

Validation Messages will be available weekly from Nov 2017-Dec 15 2017. See below for latest and greatest:


**The 12/15 metric run was delayed due to updates in the API deletion process. The next engine run will be 12/21 and validation result summary will occur before 12/25.**

1. Review Validation Messages where MessageType = Error for all 2017 visits that you sampled.  Note that past years are also available, and detailed information on updating legacy datasets can be found in the [Topographic Data Versioning](QA_Updates_pre2017surveys.md) description. 

2. Open Topographic Data with the [CHaMP Toolbar](champtools.northarrowresearch.com) if surveys need additional updates.  Revisit the Validation Error list each week until no Errors exist for your Visits.
