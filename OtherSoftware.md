## Geodatabase Exporter	

In 2016 a tool was developed to export CHaMP Survey geodatabase products to a non-geodatabase format, such as shapefiles.  This tool was initially dubbed 'Harold' and is generally called the Geodatbase Exporter Tool.  This enables non-ESRI software access to the files, which ultimately provides open source software access to data.  

Tool code has been re-purposed to change the data export format and the source geodatabases.  

Code is stored in a BitBucket repository and managed by Kelly Whitehead.  

Code is updated as needed to meet program geodatabase exporting needs.
