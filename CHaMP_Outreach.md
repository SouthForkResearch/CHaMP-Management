# CHaMP Outreach

CHaMP has utilized several forms of outreach communication to engage and share CHaMP analyses and tools with engaged participants.  The form and content of these events has changed over the years;  the pilot years of the program (2011-2013) focused on refinement and review of the CHaMP data collection process, implementation and tools through post-season debriefing meetings with CHaMP participants while 2014-2016 Outreach has focused on fish-habitat modeling tools and analyses.

<u>Post-season meetings</u> (2011-2013)

CHaMP hosted annual December post-season wrap up meetings as a means to share data analyses to date and gather feedback from CHaMP participants on the protocol, designs, data flow, and metrics.  Updates on CHaMP fish habitat relationships and models were also shared.

<u>Analytical Planning</u> (2014)

CHaMP shared analytical plans and progress to date in a February Analysis Meeting with BPA and the Power Planning Council.  The focus of this meeting was to outline the application and utility of CHaMP products towards Key Management Questions (KMQs).

<u>CHaMP Camp Analytical Training Workshops</u> (2015-2016)

Advancements and use of CHaMP analytical tools and fish-habitat models were shared and taught at the 2015-2016 CHaMP Camp Workshops.  These Workshops were held concurrently with CHaMP Camp (annually in Cove, OR) for three days as many interested parties were already in attendance at CHaMP Camp.

<u>**Network and Site Metric and Product Review Workshops (Fall 2017)**</u>

In 2017, CHaMP plans to continue outreach activities by engaging CoManagers and interested parties in hands-on review sessions of network and site-based metrics and products generated by CHaMP.  The proposed structure will be 3-4 'road show' workshops that will include hands-on data review and a series of product-update presentations.  Product Review Workshops are expected to begin in early Fall 2017.
