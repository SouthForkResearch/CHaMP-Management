# Step 3: Tag Visits with Purpose

Tags are used to help track the objectives of the Visit and are updated by Crew Leads or Watershed Managers after the field season.

Navigate to the Visit tab of your Watershed and Review Tags. Select the Tag Icon to Update the Tags.

The <u>Visit Objective</u> should be updated by double clicking on the cell.  ***Primary visits*** are usually the first visit to a site by the local sampling Organization.  Repeat visits are labeled as ***QC Visits*** and usually occur later in the season.

### <u>Tag List:</u>

**CHaMP Core:**  Visits to site funded directly through CHaMP and part of a watershed-wide sampling design. Note that not all sites within core watersheds should be considered CHaMP core if they do not meet study
design requirements.

**CHaMP 10% Revisit**:  Visit is part of the 10% repeat sampling variability design.  Primary and repeat visits should both be tagged.  Applicable for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016.
