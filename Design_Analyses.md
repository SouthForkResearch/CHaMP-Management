# Design-Based Analyses

The spatially-balanced sampling design used by CHaMP can be used to generate design-based estimates of status and trend for individual metrics at the scale of the design. Since most CHaMP design have a spatial scale of a watershed, the general status and trend estimates for CHaMP metrics are generated for the entire watershed.
