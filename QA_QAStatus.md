# QA Status Information

There are four locations on CHaMPmonitoring.org for reviewing and entering Quality Assurance (QA) information. Note that only certain User Roles may update QA information and User Permissions may need updating if updates are not possible.  

### 1) Watershed Review of QA Status

The QA Status tab visible at the Watershed scale is accessible by navigating to a Watershed, clicking on 'Measurements' tab and then the 'QA Status' tab.  QA Status settings for all Measurement Types for all Visits in a watershed can be *reviewed* here, but not updated.

### 2) Reviewing and Passing QA Statuses of Visits

At the Visit scale, the QA Status tab allows multiple Measurement Type tables to be 'Passed' at the same time. This can be done by selected multiple checkboxes to the left of the SiteName.   All other notes,  non-passing status assignment, and changes to statuses are done in the Measurement Type view (#3 of this list).  The Visit scale can be reached by clicking on any VisitID.

### 3) Setting QA Statuses and Notes for Measurement Types 

Navigate to the Measurements tab of individual Visits to set non-passing QA Statuses, change QA Statuses, and add notes.  Select a Measurement Type and then the QA Notes tab. QA Notes tabs exist for each data type (Auxiliary, Topographic, etc.)

<u>Not Assessed:</u>  No QA Status set or not assessed.  Note that QA status setting functionality in 2011-2013 was limited, and not-assessed is assumed to be a status of Pass unless otherwise noted.

<u>Pass:</u> Data is complete and passes crew QA review

<u>Does not Pass:</u>  Data exists but did not pass QA review (invalid outliers, non-repairable missing/incomplete data, reoccupation issue)

<u>Data Not Available:</u>  No data available for the Measurement Type.  Notes should describe why data was not available (e.g. equipment failure, no time, or exceptional protocol deviation).  



### 4) Adding Notes to Individual Grid Records

For Auxiliary data, notes can be added to each individual grid record of each Measurement Type grid.  Click in the Data Update Notes cell with the '-' to add/update notes.
