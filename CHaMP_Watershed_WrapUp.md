## CHaMP Watershed Wrap-Up 

Due to the unknown watershed sampling plans for 2018 we are collating and documenting organizational knowledge of Seasons, Sites and Visits that might not be captured in routine seasonal QA and review.   These items will help ensure the consistency and integrity of 2011-2017 data. 

We recommend Watershed Managers and Crew Leads discuss taking the following actions:

- **Load Site or Visit specific documentation to champmonitoring.org** (Site Documents or Visit Documents tab) via the web interface.  Crews with helpful QA, restoration, or workflow notes for sites or visits should consider storing such metadata with the measurements.   If this would be a lengthy process due to the number of documents, they will be stored on Dropbox until batch-upload to the website.   Contact Carol for file upload permissions or Dropbox location information.
- **Review non-promoted Visits from past years.**  Updates to the metric generation process in 2017 have unblocked visits from past years that did not pass RBT validation.  Metrics should be reviewed for these visits. If promotion is not appropriate, notes describing all non-promoted visits should be added to the VisitInformation QA Notes tab or the Topographic QA Notes tab, depending on the data status.  
- **Review and update QA table statuses from 2011-2016.**  The within season metric review for each year has varied in its use of these tables.  Consider 'passing' or updating notes for visits on these tables if multi-year review of metrics has recently been done.  
- **Restoration status documentation.**  Sites that have been used for project scale reference or treatment sites should be documented in an Excel file (SiteID, VisitID, Restoration Group or Identification information, and Pre or Post status). 
- **Compile Reports and Presentations relying on CHaMP data.**  CHaMP would like to compile annual reports, presentations, and technical reports that have been useful for organizations or watersheds.  
- **Stream Temperature:**  Ensure all anomalies from all years for all sites have resolutions.  
- **Review all years of all metrics (Graph review).**  This can be done by reviewing each year separately or all years at once, depending on the number of Visits/year and time available for the task.  A folder of box plots of all sites with more than 1 visit is also available for review.  
- **Document known reoccupation issues or non-standard surveys (e.g. LiDAR merging)**.  This can be done on the QA tab of topographic survey or as separate site/visit document.  We recommend generating a Site Document (e.g. a word or text file) that describes the special circumstances or known reoccupation status for the site.

### Additional checks and status information that will be completed by the program: 

- **Review and ensure metric completeness for all years of sampling**. 

- **Review and ensure field file upload completeness.  ** Includes status of historic visits versioned to 2016-2017 CHaMP TopoToolbar.

- **Review and ensure model file completeness:** 

  - substrate raster  
  - hydraulic model inputs
  - hydraulic model low flow products
  - hydraulic model high flow products (at least 1 per site)
  - GIS friendly hydraulic model output products
  - HSI and FIS v1
  - CAD Exports

- **Spatially balanced sampling files for all years:**

  - Evaluation review 
  - Geospatial frame
  - Results summary
