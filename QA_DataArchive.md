## Data Archiving
The following steps can be taken to archive a full suite of measurement, metric and model products for CHaMP.  We recommend saving these products in a folder called CHaMP_ProductsDL_YEARMMDD  on a local server. Archiving a local copy of the data should be repeated annually or after major updating and processing events.

### Files, Metrics and Model Products
1. Download Measurements database from the Data Exports tab of champmonitoring.org
2. Download Metrics .csv from the Workbench (Tools/Review Metrics)
3. Save a copy of your Active version of the SQL Workbench database
