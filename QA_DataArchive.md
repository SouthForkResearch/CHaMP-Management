## Data Archiving
The following steps can be taken to archive a full suite of measurement, metric and model products for CHaMP.  We recommend saving these products in a folder called CHaMP_ProductsDL_YEARMMDD  on a local server. Archiving a local copy of the data should be repeated annually or after major updating and processing events.

### Files, Metrics and Model Products
From CHaMPMonitoring.org:
1. Download Measurements database, Study Design database, and Temperature Metrics database from the Program-wide Data Exports tab 
2. Download Temperature Measurements Database from the Data Exports tab of EACH WATERSHED of interest.  Temperature Measurements databases are only available on Watershed-specific Export tabs due to file sizes. 

From the CHaMP Workbench:
3. Download Metrics .csv from the Workbench (Tools/Review Metrics)
4. Save a copy of your Active version of the SQL Workbench database
