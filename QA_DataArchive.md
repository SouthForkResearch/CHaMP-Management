## Data Archiving
The following steps can be taken to archive a full suite of measurement, metric and model products for CHaMP.  We recommend saving these products in a folder called CHaMP_ProductsDL_YEARMMDD  on a local server. Archiving a local copy of the data should be repeated annually or after major updating and processing events.

### Files, Metrics and Model Products
_From CHaMPMonitoring.org:_
1. Download Measurements database, Study Design database, and Temperature Metrics database from the Program-wide Data Exports tab 
2. Download Temperature Measurements Database from the Data Exports tab of EACH WATERSHED of interest.  Temperature Measurements databases are only available on Watershed-specific Export tabs due to file sizes. 

_From the CHaMP Workbench:_  
3. Download Metrics .csv from the Workbench (Tools/Review Metrics)  
4. Save a copy of your Active version of the SQL Workbench database   
5. Download files and model products using the Data menu item "Download API Files".  Before doing this step, Use the "Syncrhonize CHaMP Data" Option (also in the Data menu) to retrieve a list of all files available for your visits.  
* Note that it may be necessary to download files for ~10 visits at a time to avoid download errors.
