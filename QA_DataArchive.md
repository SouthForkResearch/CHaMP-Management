## Data Archiving
The following steps can be taken to archive a full suite of measurement, metric and model products for CHaMP.  We recommend saving these products in a folder called CHaMP_ProductsDL_YEARMMDD  on a local server. Archiving a local copy of the data should be repeated annually or after major updating and processing events.

### Files, Metrics and Model Products
_From CHaMPMonitoring.org:_  
1. Download Measurements database, Study Design database, and Temperature Metrics database from the [Program-wide Data Exports tab](https://www.champmonitoring.org/DataExport/Details/1#tab-overview) 
2. Download Temperature Measurements Database from the Data Exports tab of EACH WATERSHED of interest.  Temperature Measurements databases are only available on Watershed-specific Export tabs due to file sizes. 

_From the CHaMP Workbench:_  
- 3. Download Metrics .csv from the Workbench [Tools menu/Review Metrics](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Tools_Menu/Metrics/metric_review.html)  
4. Save a copy of your Active version of the [SQL Workbench database](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Technical_Reference/working_with_sqlite_databases.html)   
5. Download files and model products using the Data menu item "[Download API Files](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Data_Menu/download_champ_data.html)".  Before doing this step, Use the "[Syncrhonize CHaMP Data](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com//Data_Menu/synchronize_champ_data.html)" Option (also in the Data menu) to retrieve a list of all files available for your visits.  
* Note that it may be necessary to download files for ~10 visits at a time to avoid download errors.
