## Metric Documentation

### [Metric Descriptions](https://github.com/SouthForkResearch/CHaMP_Metrics/wiki)
An entire wiki is devoted to describing definitions, calculations, changes, and use cases for the metrics.    

### Metric Data Dictionaries
Data dictionaries are used to define the metrics that display on champmonitoring.org.  From 2011-Spring 2017 the data dictionaries were used to control static views.  With the completion of the API in spring 2017 the metric views were changed to a dynamic system and metric schemas managed in the CHamP Workbench became the active method for controlling metric views on champmonitoring.org.  

*  [2017 Schema xmls](https://github.com/SouthForkResearch/CHaMP_Metrics/tree/master/xml).  A more user-friendly form of these schemas are available by synching a [CHaMP Workbench](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/) to champmonitoring and reviewing the downloadable schemas.  A [Metric Definitions](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Data_Menu/MetricDefinitions.html) table that provides metadata links and definitions of all metrics is also available in the Workbench.

### Metric Performance (Variance Decomposition)
[Variance Decomposition for 2011-2017](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fubr0xn118n24dx/CHaMP%20Variance%20Decomposition_All%20CHaMP%20Metrics.jpg?dl=0)    
The variance decomposition code is stored in the [GRTS analysis Code Repository](https://southforkresearch.github.io/CHaMP-Status-and-Trend-Roll-Ups/).
