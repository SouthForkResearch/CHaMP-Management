A field crew collects both topographic data and auxiliary data at a CHaMP site. Some of the data requires post processing before uploading it to champmonitoring.org. The field crew processes the topographic data using the CHaMP topographic toolbar, and processes some of the auxiliary data using other software. Only two types of auxiliary data needs to be processed before upload to champmonitoring.org: the stream temperature data and the solar radiation data. The field crew uses Hoboware software to export stream temperature files (.csv and .hobo), and uses Solmetric Suneye software to process Suneye data. All of the other auxiliary data is directly uploaded to champmonitoring.org. 

Documents containing instructions for processing topo data, stream temp data, and solar input data are available on [champmonitoring.org](https://www.champmonitoring.org/Program/Details/1#tab-documents). Additionally, copies of these instructional documents are available in the CHaMP Management dropbox folder:

[Toolbar/survey gdb](TopoDataProcessing.md) and the [Topographic Toolbar](CHaMP Topographic Toolbar.md)

At some sites, crews may collect solar radiation data using a Solar Pathfinder. Solar Pathfinder data is processed using the the Solar Pathfinder Assistant 4.0 software. Instructions for processing the solar pathfinder data can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/pri/get/CHaMP_files/CHaMP_Management/data_processing/Solar_Input/SolarPathfinder_Processing%20Instructions.pdf?_subject_uid=344962207&w=AADhIjvY8mxOSs5r1Qth2tHOcD_lMB-GvwvXcibzW3m83A). Additionally, the [Solar Pathfinder Assistant manual](https://www.dropbox.com/pri/get/CHaMP_files/CHaMP_Management/data_processing/Solar_Input/pathfinder-manual.pdf?_subject_uid=344962207&w=AAA8uqU3mh6qVvu5y6m1h9q6OHzrvjTsdzbeAkDiANmspA) is also available.

Once the crew processes the topographic data, stream temperature data, and the solar radiation data, the crew uploads these data to champmonitoring.org. Additionally, the crew will upload the scanned paper forms and maps, site photos, and auxiliary data files to champmonitoring.org. The [Data Upload Utility manual](https://www.dropbox.com/pri/get/CHaMP_files/CHaMP_Management/data_processing/GeoOptix/GeoOptix%20Field%20Data%20Upload%20Utility%20%282017%29-ee006747-fe39-4520-af97-f396bfa3e60f.pdf?_subject_uid=344962207&w=AAAVp6PQc8KmoI20C7i4GHfUplrR76Lc_xDNL_w3Wy1egg) describes the steps to follow when uploading each data component to champmonitoring.org. The [GeoOptix Mobile Users Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/pri/get/CHaMP_files/CHaMP_Management/data_processing/GeoOptix/GeoOptix%20Mobile%20Users%20Guide%20%282017%29-2cfb5ce6-73f8-4a2f-8178-db0942bdd03d.pdf?_subject_uid=344962207&w=AABmgIhT0QObRBtb2knnKa21FFaPqe5ZQTjH7qF8B-dgnA) describes the procedure for uploading the auxiliary data files directly from the GeoOptix software on the iPad to champmonitoring.org.
