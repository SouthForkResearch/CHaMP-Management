# CHaMP Post-Season Quality Assurance Process 



For 2017, the end-of-season quality assurance review will
build upon the quality assurance already completed during the end-of-day
validation on the ipad, the post-process qa review in the GIS CHaMP Toolbar,
and end-of-hitch validation performed while publishing data in the Data Broker
(see Section 9 of the CHaMP field protocol).
