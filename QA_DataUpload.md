# Step 2: Complete Data Upload

1. Navigate to the [Field Data Upload Utility](https://broker.champmonitoring.org/)
2. Select Hitches. Review each Hitch in the current season to ensure all file packages have been loaded for each Visit.
3. Note: If Hitches that are not yours are present in the Hitch list, Update your FDUU Settings by selecting the ![Settings Icon](https://southforkresearch.github.io/CHaMP-Management/images/FDUU_settings.png) and adjusting Iteration (Year) and Organization filters. 
4. Review Visits where Visit Phase = Data Collection and determine which Visits are missing uploaded packages of data.

   - Site Photos
   - Scanned Paper Forms and Maps
   - Topographic Data
   - Solar Input Photos
   - Stream Temp Readings
   - Air Temp Readings

5. If a package is missing, Open the Visit by selecting the VisitID and use the Upload functionality at the bottom of the Visit view.
