# Step 5: Review Control Network Metadata



Accuracy of control networks is critical since this information is used for site reoccupation.  

1. Review metadata information for monuments, benchmarks,control points, and markers.  Note that elevations were reviewed during the Measurement Review (Step 3).  
2. Review and update UTM coordinates as needed. Note that Benchmark and Control Point errors were likely repaired during Topo data review. 
3. Review notes in these tables and address any outstanding control network questions.  Leave control network metadata in a condition that allows easy use for the next visit to a site. 
4. Set the QA status for the following Measurement Types:

* Benchmark
* Site Marker
* Control Point
* Monument
