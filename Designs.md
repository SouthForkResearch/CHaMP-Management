## Within-Year Repeat Designs
The repeat design for CHaMP has changed multiple times since 2011.  


|Year|Design Notes|Documents|  
|----|------------|------------|
|2011-2013|10% repeat sampling occurred in addition to standard status and trend sampling|[Repeat Sampling Plan 2011-2013](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1x64luq4f5v6fod/Repeat%20Sampling%20study%20design_2011to2013.pdf?dl=0)
|2014|No repeat sampling|
|2015-2016| Repeat sampling integrated into normal rotating panel schedule. General approach was to turn 4 annual sites into rotating panels, which reduced annual sampling by 2 visits|[Repeat Sampling Plan 2015](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xtkxyfljn9a8gux/CHaMP%20Repeat%20Sampling%20Plan%202015_20150518_clean.pdf?dl=0), [Crew Instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7lc22r81ptpdzav/Repeat%20Sampling_2015-2016_instructions%20to%20crew%20supervisors_20160705.pdf?dl=0), [2015 Sampling Summary](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c3yck46fat6tqaf/Repeat%20Sampling_2015_summary_20151113.pdf?dl=0)|    
|2017| No repeat sampling   |  


## Process

1. Each year the CHaMP Design Team (Carol Volk and Matt Nahorniak) checks with all Organizations with active CHaMP designs to determine design needs for the upcoming field season.

2. Programmatic needs that may also affect study designs are collected by the Design Team

3. Sampling needs for AEM are collected

4. Design needs for Organizations (#1) and the Program (#1) are reviewed for each design (and watershed) and proposed to each Organization.

5. Designs are drafted in MonitoringResources.org.  

   If only slight modifications to designs are needed, then:

   1. Any change to the Frame, Sites, Panels, Number of Visits, Use Order, or Strata triggers a new design for the year.  A design is cloned, renamed with the updated year at the end
   2. Changes to designs are noted in the MonitoringResources.org 'Design' or 'Frame' descriptions.  All changes should be documented (e.g. list sites and use orders, strata affected, rationale, etc) 
   3. The protocol name, organization, study duration, start year, and end year are reviewed for accuracy.
   4. Designs are finalized

   If designs are modified such that a new GRTS draw is required, new strata are established, or the frame in englarged, a NEW design might be required.  If this is the case, then the design documentation process in MonitoringResources.org is more involved.

6. In CHaMPmonitoring.org, finalized designs are then registered in the Design References tab.  One must have a "Designer" Role in CHaMPmonitoring.org to complete this task.  Registration of designs takes place immediately.  If an error occurs, the design should be reviewed in MonitoringResources.org. 

   1. Troubleshooting Design Registration. When designs do not appear in CHaMPmonitoring.org as expected, these are common issues to review:
      1. Design is not active for the year. The start year and panel duration of the design must cover the current-year field season.  For example, if a design started in 2011 and is a 5 year design, the design will only be active for 2011-2016 and will not appear for 2017.
      2. Duplicate site registration.  A site can only be incorporated into 1 design in the system.


1. Review Design in Field Support tab to ensure sites were registered.
