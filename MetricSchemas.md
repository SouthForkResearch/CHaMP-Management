# Metric Schemas

Metrics can be viewed in different groupings, called [*schemas*](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Data_Menu/Metric-Schemas.html).  Schemas use the following naming convention:

*Schema State - Engine & Resolution & Date (Program)* 

such as:

*QA - Aux Visit Metrics (CHaMP)* 

#### <u>Schema Status</u>

CHaMP has two schema statuses that are visible on champmonitoring.org and the Workbench, QA and Final. 

***QA schemas*** contain draft metrics that have not been released to the public.  These schemas contain draft data in review by crews and the most recent generation of metrics for all visits. In these schemas metrics are grouped by model or engine. ONE copy of metrics are synced from [champmonitoring.org](www.champmonitoring.org) at a time, which means that metrics in these schemas are *replaced* during [Metric Download](http://workbench.northarrowresearch.com/Data_Menu/download_metrics.html).  

- QA - Aux Visit Metrics (CHaMP)  
- QA - Aux Tier 1 Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - Aux Channel Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - Topo Visit Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - Topo Tier 1 Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - Topo Tier 2 Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - Topo Channel Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - TopoAux Visit Metrics (CHaMP)
- QA - TopoAux Tier 1 Metrics (CHaMP)



***Final schemas*** contain snapshots of metrics at particular dates, as described.  These schemas are copies of the QA schemas that have received additional quality assurance and completeness checks and can only be produced by CHaMP Quality Assurance staff.  These schemas do not change over time, but new snapshots of metrics may be generated and are distinguished by date.  Note that local workbenches may contain more schemas than what is available on champmonitoring.org.
